              <p>Amani is a start-up that focuses on financial and regulation technologies, primarily targeting blockchain orientated applications. As the lead backend developer, I was tasked
              with establishing a connection with the databases and the blockchain chain by designing a custom API, as well as develop smart contracts via Ethereum's Solidity.
              In December 2016, we participated in the first regulation hackathon held in Canada (RegHackTO), and showcased our alpha web application. </p><a href="https://github.com/jkyenkungu/reghack">View Amani Source Code</a>

                the app allows one to hand/style draw notations and provides plesant colour changes to the UI as visual cues relative to the amount of tasks one has. As a personal project, it is still 
                in production with no intention of being published on the App stores.</p><a href="https://appetize.io/app/hb3k7evp1cdgmqjx80ppkbaacr">Try Demo</a>

              <p>A group of three computer science students and I decided to develop a more
                interactive and intuitive university course searching website. Course Flex's goal was to provide a user-friendly website for UofT students to explore courses with ease by
                catering to their interests, optimizing the search function and allowing students to post ratings and reviews.
                The course required all of us to be active in all stages of development, implementing JQuery for the frontend and, Node with MongoDB for our Backend.</p><a href="https://strawberry-cupcake-85655.herokuapp.com/">Visit Website</a>

          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>Hi, My name is <span class="goldy">Jovin Kyenkungu.</span> I am a fullstack web and android developer currently completing my Computer Science
            degree at the University of Toronto. As a fullstack developer, I am well versed in <span class="goldy">JS, NoSQL, SQL and React</span> and whilst my
            preference to develop for android arises from my love of <span class="goldy">Java</span>, the broad school curriculum has taught me to be comfortabled with other languages such as
            <span class="goldy">C and Haskell</span>. In addition to being a full-time student, I like to spend my spare time working with digital media, exploring all
            fields from graphic design to music composition.

              <p>For a semester long project required by CSC309: Developing On The Web, Me plus a group of three computer science students decided to develop a more
                interactive and intuitive university course searching website. Course Flex's goal was to provide a user-friendly website for UofT students to explore courses with ease by
                catering to their interests, optimizing the search function and allowing students to post ratings and reviews.
                The course required all of us to be active in all stages of development, implementing JQuery for the frontend and, Node with MongoDB for our Backend.</p><a href="https://strawberry-cupcake-85655.herokuapp.com/">Visit Website</a>

              <p>Amani is a start-up that focuses on financial and regulation technologies, primarily targeting blockchain orientated applications. As the lead backend developer, I am tasked
              with securing the connection with our databases and the blockchain chain through BlockApps STRATO, as well as develop smart contracts via Ethereum Solidity.
              In December 2016, we participated in the first regulation hackathon held in Canada (RegHackTO), and showcased our alpha web application. </p><a href="https://github.com/jkyenkungu/reghack">View Amani Source Code</a>

              <p>As a member of StallionEye, we participated in WearHacks Montreal as an opportunity to examine and discover new technologies. Developing with Estimote,
              we created a native iOS application that enables user locations to be tracked in an allocated space by another user, targeting teachers and parents. Delegated to do the backend,
              I worked on bluetooth connectivity and position tracking on Swift.  </p><a href="#">Visit Github Project</a>

              <p>StallionEye is a start-up that my friends and I founded in our last years of university focusing on creating a social and collaborative application by taking advantage
                of the ever new technologies available. Working with like-minded individuals, yet in various fields of student, we created an android video streaming application, our goal being
              to aid the casual or avid broadcaster record, edit and post their content effortlessly. As the frontend developer, I was responsible for UI design for both the android application and web client.

              webpage. Utilizing wordpress plus some custom CSS, I satisfied his requirements for a simple, flat design that he can easily edit and modify when new content is created. In addition to this,
              I provide user engagement feedback from his various social media profiles via their respective analytics platforms.</p><a href="https://www.eyeamionline.com">Visit Website</a>
